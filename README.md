# QuickMemo Extractor
A program that extracts the content of a QuickMemo+ file.
QuickMemo+ is a note-making application for LG Smartphones.
The file extensions of QuickMemo+ files are (.lqm) and (.jlqm).

## Background
This program was created after my LG G3 cellphone broke and I needed the information I wrote in QuickMemo+.
Luckily, I had a backup of my notes, but there was no app available to open the QuickMemo files.

## What I've Learned
- The structure of a QuickMemo+ file is similar to a JSON file
- Extracting and Parsing JSON content with Java
- Creating the Open File Dialogs
- Creating custom text files with the extracted content from a JSON
- Generating a JAR file
